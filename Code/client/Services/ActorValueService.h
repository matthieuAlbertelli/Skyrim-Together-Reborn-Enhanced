 * This service is also responsible for applying incoming actor value changes.
 * Health uses two complementary paths: immediate delta events for combat/effects,
 * plus periodic absolute snapshots through the regular actor-value channel. The
 * snapshots cover native regeneration and reconcile any drift from delta prediction.
 *
 * This service is also responsible for syncing the death states of individual actors.
 * The death state is perdiocally checked and compared to cached death states.
